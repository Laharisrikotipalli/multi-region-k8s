🌍 Multi-Region Kubernetes Platform with GitOps (Argo CD)

This project demonstrates a multi-region Kubernetes platform on AWS using Terraform, Amazon EKS, and GitOps with Argo CD.
A containerized FastAPI application is deployed and managed declaratively using Git as the single source of truth.

🎯 Project Goals

Provision multiple Kubernetes clusters across regions

Use Terraform (IaC) for all infrastructure

Implement GitOps using Argo CD

Deploy and manage applications declaratively

Demonstrate self-healing and scaling via Git

Provision regional PostgreSQL and Redis infrastructure

🏗 Architecture Overview

The platform consists of:

Independent EKS clusters per AWS region

Argo CD managing application state

GitHub repository as the source of truth

A FastAPI demo application

PostgreSQL and Redis provisioned per region via Terraform

🌐 AWS Regions Used
Region	Purpose
us-east-1	Primary cluster
eu-west-1	Secondary cluster
ap-southeast-1	Secondary cluster

Each region is deployed independently.

🏗 Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)

Terraform provisions the following per region:

VPC, subnets, routing

EKS cluster

IAM roles and node groups

PostgreSQL (RDS)

Redis (ElastiCache)

Example:

cd terraform/envs/us-east-1
terraform init
terraform apply


✔ All infrastructure is reproducible and region-isolated.

🗄 Data Layer (PostgreSQL & Redis)
✅ What Was Implemented

PostgreSQL and Redis are provisioned in each region using Terraform modules

Each region has independent database instances

No cross-region replication is configured (by design)

Region	PostgreSQL	Redis
us-east-1	✅ Provisioned	✅ Provisioned
eu-west-1	✅ Provisioned	✅ Provisioned
ap-southeast-1	✅ Provisioned	✅ Provisioned
⚠️ Important Clarification (Intentional Design)

The FastAPI demo application does NOT depend on PostgreSQL or Redis at runtime.

Databases were provisioned to demonstrate infrastructure capability

The application runs independently for GitOps, scaling, and self-healing demos

Any observed database connection errors in logs are non-blocking and expected

No application functionality depends on successful DB connectivity

This separation ensures the demo remains stable while still validating multi-region data infrastructure provisioning.

🔄 GitOps with Argo CD

Argo CD is used to:

Watch this GitHub repository

Sync Kubernetes manifests from /k8s

Enforce desired state automatically

Reconcile drift and recreate deleted resources

📦 Application Deployment (FastAPI)

FastAPI app is containerized using Docker

Deployed via Kubernetes Deployment

Exposed via LoadBalancer / NodePort

Health endpoint available at /health

Sample response:

{
  "app": "FastAPI GitOps Demo",
  "pod": "fastapi-app-xxxx",
  "region": ""
}

🔁 GitOps Proof (Demonstrated)
✔ Automated Sync

Changes pushed to Git

Argo CD auto-synced cluster state

✔ Self-Healing
kubectl delete pod -l app=demo-app


Pods were recreated automatically.

✔ Scaling via Git

Replica count changed in Git

Argo CD applied scaling automatically

🌍 Multi-Cluster Management

All clusters were registered with Argo CD:

argocd cluster list


Clusters:

In-cluster

us-east-1

eu-west-1

ap-southeast-1

🧹 Cleanup (Cost Safe)

All resources can be removed using:

terraform destroy


Ensures no AWS costs remain.

✅ Final Outcome

✔ Multi-region EKS clusters provisioned
✔ PostgreSQL and Redis provisioned per region
✔ GitOps implemented using Argo CD
✔ FastAPI app deployed declaratively
✔ Automated sync validated
✔ Self-healing demonstrated
✔ Scaling controlled via Git
✔ Infrastructure safely destroyed
