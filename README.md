# 🌍 Multi-Region Kubernetes Platform using GitOps (AWS EKS)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **production-grade, multi-region Kubernetes platform** built on **AWS EKS**, fully managed using **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)** and **GitOps (Argo CD)**.

The platform is designed to:
- Deploy Kubernetes clusters in **multiple geographic regions**
- Ensure **high availability and resilience**
- Use **Git as the single source of truth**
- Automatically **self-heal applications**
- Support **regional isolation and failover readiness**

A **FastAPI application** is deployed consistently across regions using GitOps.
## 🌐 Deployed Regions

The Kubernetes platform is deployed across **three AWS regions** to simulate a global, highly available setup:

- **us-east-1** (N. Virginia)
- **eu-west-1** (Ireland)
- **ap-southeast-1** (Singapore)

Each region contains:
- An independent **EKS cluster**
- Dedicated **VPC, subnets, and node groups**
- Regional **FastAPI application deployment**
- Region-specific **LoadBalancer services**

This design ensures that each region can operate independently and supports disaster recovery and failover scenarios.

  ## 🔁 GitOps Workflow with Argo CD
This project follows a **pure GitOps model**, where **GitHub is the single source of truth** for application deployment.

### GitOps Flow

1. **Developer pushes changes** to the GitHub repository  
2. **Argo CD continuously monitors** the repository
3. Argo CD **detects drift or new commits**
4. Kubernetes manifests are **automatically applied**
5. If manual changes occur in the cluster, Argo CD **self-heals** them

---

### Argo CD Application Configuration

The Argo CD application is defined using `project-app.yaml` and includes:

- **Automated sync enabled**
- **Pruning of removed resources**
- **Self-healing of drifted resources**

```yaml
syncPolicy:
  automated:
    prune: true
    selfHeal: true
```
Application Status Verification

Argo CD provides real-time visibility into:

Sync status (Synced / OutOfSync)

Health status (Healthy / Degraded)

Resource-level drift detection

Example Argo CD CLI output:
argocd app get multi-region-app
----
## 🚀 Application Deployment (FastAPI)

A **FastAPI-based backend service** is deployed to each Kubernetes cluster using a standardized Kubernetes manifest managed by Argo CD.

### Application Features

- REST API built with **FastAPI**
- Containerized using **Docker**
- Deployed as a **Kubernetes Deployment**
- Exposed using a **LoadBalancer Service**
- Horizontally scalable using replicas

---

### Kubernetes Deployment Highlights

- Multiple replicas per region to ensure availability
- Health checks to validate application readiness
- Stateless design for easy scaling and redeployment

Example deployment behavior:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
NAME                           READY   STATUS    AGE
fastapi-app-xxxx               1/1     Running   5m
fastapi-app-yyyy               1/1     Running   5m
fastapi-app-zzzz               1/1     Running   5m
Health Endpoint

The application exposes a health endpoint used for validation:

GET /health


Sample response:

{
  "status": "ok"
}


This endpoint is used to:

Verify service availability

Validate regional deployments

Support external health checks
## 🌐 Multi-Region Strategy & Failover Testing

This project is designed to operate across **multiple AWS regions**, ensuring that the application remains available even if one entire region becomes unavailable.

### Regions Used

- **us-east-1** (N. Virginia)
- **eu-west-1** (Ireland)
- **ap-southeast-1** (Singapore)

Each region contains:
- Its own **EKS cluster**
- Independent **worker nodes**
- Region-specific **application deployments**

---

## 🔁 GitOps-Based Multi-Region Deployment

Argo CD is installed in each cluster and continuously synchronizes application state from the same Git repository.

Key benefits:
- Same manifests deployed across all regions
- No manual kubectl deployments
- Git commit = deployment trigger

---

## 🧪 Failover Testing (Regional Isolation)

Failover testing was performed by **simulating a regional outage** at the application layer.

### Failover Simulation Steps

1. Switch Kubernetes context to a region:
```bash
kubectl config use-context arn:aws:eks:<region>:cluster/<cluster-name>
```
Scale application replicas to zero:

kubectl scale deployment fastapi-app --replicas=0


Verify service impact:

kubectl get pods


Confirm that:

Other regions remain healthy

Application continues serving traffic from remaining regions

✅ Failover Validation

Each region operates independently

Failure in one region does not affect others

Demonstrates regional fault isolation

This confirms the platform’s ability to survive regional application failures.
## 📊 Observability (Monitoring & Logging)

Observability is a key requirement for operating distributed, multi-region systems.  
This project integrates **basic observability practices** to monitor application and infrastructure health across regions.

---

## 🔍 Health Monitoring

Each deployed FastAPI service exposes a `/health` endpoint that provides a simple health status response.

Example check:

```bash
curl http://<load-balancer-dns>/health
```
Sample response:

{
  "status": "ok"
}


This endpoint is used to:

Validate application availability

Perform manual health checks during testing

Support future integration with automated monitoring tools

📜 Logging

Application logs are accessible via Kubernetes logs

Logs help validate:

Pod startup

Request handling

Error conditions

Example:

kubectl logs <pod-name>

📈 Future Improvements

The platform is designed to easily integrate:

Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

Centralized logging (ELK / CloudWatch)

Distributed tracing (Jaeger / OpenTelemetry)

This ensures the architecture is monitoring-ready for production.
## 🗄️ Data Layer (PostgreSQL & Redis)

This project includes a **data layer provisioned per region** using **Terraform**, consisting of **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** services.

---

## 🐘 PostgreSQL (Per Region)

- PostgreSQL instances were provisioned **independently in each AWS region**
- Infrastructure was fully managed using **Terraform**
- Designed to support future **cross-region replication strategies**

### Intended Design

- Each region has its own database instance
- Application connects to the regional database
- Supports fault isolation and regional independence

### Observed Behavior

- PostgreSQL resources were successfully created via Terraform
- Database connectivity from the application layer showed intermittent issues
- This was identified as a **configuration-level challenge**, not an infrastructure failure

The database layer is included to demonstrate:
- Multi-region state management awareness
- Infrastructure provisioning capability
- Understanding of production data-layer complexity

---

## ⚡ Redis (Caching Layer)

- Redis instances were also provisioned per region
- Intended to be used for:
  - Caching frequently accessed data
  - Reducing database load
  - Improving response latency

### Status

- Redis infrastructure successfully created
- Application integration planned as a next enhancement

---

## 📌 Design Note

This project focuses on **infrastructure, GitOps, and resilience**, not application-level data modeling.  
The inclusion of PostgreSQL and Redis demonstrates:

- Awareness of stateful workloads
- Multi-region data considerations
- Real-world system design trade-offs

Further improvements could include:
- Managed replication (Aurora Global Database)
- Secrets management
- Connection pooling
## 🚨 Disaster Recovery (DR) & Runbook Summary

This project includes a **documented and testable disaster recovery strategy** focused on **regional resilience** and **application continuity**.

---

## 🎯 DR Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Minimal (seconds to minutes)
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Depends on database configuration (regional isolation)

The platform is designed so that:
- A **single regional failure does not impact other regions**
- Application remains available from healthy regions

---

## 🧪 Disaster Simulation Approach

Instead of destroying infrastructure, DR testing was performed safely at the **application layer**.

### Simulated Failure Steps

1. Switch context to a target region:
```bash
kubectl config use-context arn:aws:eks:<region>:cluster/<cluster-name>
```
Simulate outage:

kubectl scale deployment fastapi-app --replicas=0


Verify:

kubectl get pods


Validate:

Application in other regions continues running

Load balancer endpoints remain healthy

🔁 Recovery Procedure

To restore a failed region:

kubectl scale deployment fastapi-app --replicas=<desired-count>


Argo CD automatically:

Detects drift

Reconciles desired state

Restores application health
