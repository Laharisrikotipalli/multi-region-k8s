project:
  title: "Multi-Region Kubernetes Platform using GitOps"
  description: >
    Designed and implemented a multi-region Kubernetes platform on AWS using
    Terraform, Amazon EKS, and Argo CD. The project demonstrates GitOps-based
    application delivery, automated synchronization, self-healing, and scaling
    using Git as the single source of truth.

infrastructure:
  cloud_provider: AWS
  regions:
    - us-east-1
    - eu-west-1
    - ap-southeast-1
  kubernetes: Amazon EKS
  provisioning: Terraform

data_layer:
  postgres: Provisioned per region using Terraform (RDS)
  redis: Provisioned per region using Terraform (ElastiCache)
  note: >
    Databases were provisioned to demonstrate infrastructure capability.
    The demo FastAPI application does not depend on database connectivity
    at runtime, and any DB connection failures are non-blocking.

gitops:
  tool: Argo CD
  features:
    - Automated synchronization
    - Drift detection and self-healing
    - Declarative application management
    - Git-based scaling

application:
  type: FastAPI
  deployment: Kubernetes Deployment
  exposure: LoadBalancer / NodePort
  healthcheck: /health

validation:
  - Git-driven application updates
  - Pod self-healing after deletion
  - Scaling via Git commits
  - Multi-cluster registration in Argo CD

cleanup:
  method: terraform destroy
  cost_safe: true
